XSentii-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This Hate Speech Detection App is a project that leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to identify hate speech in text,twitter. Built using Python, Streamlit, and NLTK, the app preprocesses text data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, applies a bag-of-words representation using CountVectorizer, and trains a Decision Tree Classifier. Users can input text for hate speech detection through a Streamlit interface, which also supports real-time speech input.

Features:
Hate speech detection using a Decision Tree Classifier
NLP preprocessing for text data
User-friendly Streamlit interface
Visual and text-to-speech result presentation
